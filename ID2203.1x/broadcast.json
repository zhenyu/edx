Some components such as `PerfectLink`,  `Network` and `Timer` are already provided. No need to implement them.\n2. Execute the imports defined below **before** compiling your component implementations.\n3. We recommend making use of the component state and internal messages we have provided, if any, to complete the implementation logic.\n4. You can always print messages to the output log, from within handlers to see what happens during the simulation. e.g. `println(s\"Process $self delivers message $msg\");`\n5. Remember that during the simulation check you can print and observe the simulation time, i.e. with `System.currentTimeMillis()`.\n5. Do not forget to run the checker code block after each component implementation to ensure that all properties are satisfied before exporting and submitting the notebook.\n6. You can always restart the Kompics Interpreter to start fresh (Interpreter→KompicsInterpreter→Click Restart)\n7. Do **not** submit just the grading token to edx. You will have to submit the whole exported notebook content to get your grade.\n\nGood luck! :)","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2017-11-13T22:53:17+0000","config":{"editorSetting":{},"editorMode":"ace/mode/scala","colWidth":12,"editorHide":true,"fontSize":9,"results":[{"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}}],"enabled":true,"tableHide":false},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<div class=\"markdown-body\">\n<h3>From Best Effort to Causal Order Reliable Broadcast</h3>\n<p>This is the first programming assignment where you will have to build and reuse multiple components.<br/>Starting bottom-up, you will first have to implement <em>best effort broadcast</em>, then <em>reliable broadcast</em> and finally <em>causal order reliable broadcast</em>.<br/>Mind that passing each component check will give you a <strong>partial</strong> grade and therefore you will need to pass <strong>all</strong> checks to get the full grade for this programming assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Things to Remember</strong>:<br/>1.
